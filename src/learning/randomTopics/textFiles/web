The web (short for the World Wide Web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and resources, accessed via the internet. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **The Internet**: The foundation of the web is the internet, which is a global network of computers connected through routers, cables, and wireless systems. It's what allows data to be transferred between devices worldwide.

2. **Web Browser**: To interact with the web, you use a web browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). A web browser is a software application that lets you view web pages. It translates the information from websites into something you can see and interact with on your screen.

3. **Web Servers**: Websites are stored on servers, which are powerful computers that store the files and data of the website. When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the server to retrieve the web page's files (such as HTML, images, and styles).

4. **URLs and Domain Names**: Websites are accessed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), which are addresses that guide the browser to specific content. For example, "https://www.example.com" is a URL. This URL corresponds to a domain name, which points to an IP address (a unique identifier for each server on the internet).

5. **HTTP and HTTPS**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring data over the web. HTTPS is the secure version of this protocol, using encryption to protect the data exchange between your browser and the server.

6. **Request and Response**: When you type a URL into your browser or click on a link, the browser sends a request to the server to get the necessary files for the webpage. The server then responds by sending the requested data back to the browser, which then displays the web page.

7. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Websites are built using three main technologies:
   - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: This is the basic structure of a webpage (such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images).
   - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: This controls the layout, colors, fonts, and appearance of the webpage.
   - **JavaScript**: This adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage, like pop-up messages or animations.

8. **Web Applications**: In addition to static websites, there are web applications (like Google Docs or Facebook), which offer interactive features. These often involve databases and backend systems that process user input and return real-time data.

In summary, the web works by having servers host content, browsers retrieve it using URLs, and protocols like HTTP/HTTPS govern the communication between the two. Together, these elements create the interactive, rich environment we use every day.
