Languages like java for example are platform-independent meaning
there is no difference in the source code you have to write based on the OS.
That is not the case with languages like C, C++, C# where if you go make something that is on deep level
like a game you will have to take into consideration the OS that it will be run into.

- **JavaRevise**: **Source → Compile → Bytecode → JVM → System calls**
- **Python**: **Source → Interpreter → Bytecode → PVM → System calls**
- **Bash**: **Source → Interpreter → Binary → System calls**

C#
- **Source → Compile → IL (Intermediate Language)**
- **Run IL → CLR → JIT Compilation → Machine Code → System Calls**

Just like JavaRevise and Python, C# also requires the appropriate runtime (**.NET runtime**) installed.
The key difference is that it uses **Intermediate Language (IL)**,
 which is compiled to machine code at runtime via **JIT compilation**,
instead of running directly as bytecode or binaries.
