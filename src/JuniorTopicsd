Here's a comprehensive list of topics you should be familiar with for a junior Java interview:

1. Core Java Fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
- Java syntax and basic programming constructs
- Data types and variables
- Operators
- Control flow statements (if-else, switch, loops)

2. Java Collections Framework
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- HashMap
- HashSet
- TreeMap
- Queue and Stack implementations
- Difference between List, Set, and Map interfaces
- Generics

3. Exception Handling
- Try-catch blocks
- Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
- Throwing and handling exceptions
- Custom exception creation
- Finally block

4. Object-Oriented Programming Deep Dive
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- Method overloading and overriding
- Abstract classes vs Interfaces
- Enum types
- Composition vs Inheritance

5. Java Memory Management
- Stack vs Heap memory
- Garbage Collection basics
- Reference types (Strong, Weak, Soft)

6. Fundamental Java Classes
- String and StringBuilder
- Math class
- Date and Time API (java.time package)
- Wrapper classes

7. Basic Multithreading
- Thread creation (extending Thread class vs implementing Runnable)
- Synchronization
- Thread lifecycle
- Basic concurrency concepts

8. Input/Output Operations
- File handling
- Reading and writing files
- Basic stream operations
- Try-with-resources

9. Java 8+ Features
- Lambda expressions
- Stream API
- Optional class
- Method references
- Default methods in interfaces

10. Basic Programming Concepts
- Algorithmic thinking
- Simple data structures
- Basic sorting and searching algorithms
- Time and space complexity basics

11. Build Tools and Development Environment
- Maven or Gradle basics
- Understanding of project structure
- Basic version control with Git

12. Testing
- JUnit basics
- Writing simple unit tests
- Test-driven development concepts

Interview Preparation Tips:
- Practice coding on a whiteboard or paper
- Be prepared to explain your code
- Know the "why" behind your implementation
- Understand basic design principles
- Show eagerness to learn and solve problems

Sample Interview Questions to Practice:
- Implement a custom ArrayList
- Write a program to reverse a string
- Create a simple thread-safe singleton
- Implement a method to check if a string is a palindrome
- Design a basic caching mechanism

Technical Skills to Demonstrate:
- Clean, readable code
- Understanding of best practices
- Ability to explain technical concepts clearly
- Problem-solving approach
- Willingness to learn and improve

Remember, for a junior position, interviewers are often more interested in your potential, learning ability, and fundamental understanding rather than expecting expert-level knowledge. Show enthusiasm, be honest about what you know, and demonstrate your capability to learn quickly.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these topics or provide some sample code examples to help you prepare?
