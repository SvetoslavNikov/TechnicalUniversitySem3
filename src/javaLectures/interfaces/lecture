Why there is no double inheritance in java;


class A int x
class B int x
class C int x
class d int x

interface always in a separate file
//interface example goceva git
//interfaceDEMO
//interfacesample
//lambda
//exceptions Example2/3/4
example 4 -  we have to write throws after the main OR try catch method if we expect to throw an error
otherwise it wont compile!!!why is that different

throwable is a special class for exceptions -...

initialize an object of the interface type so we can access the different implementations of the method in different classes
 Interface1
    ^
    |
 Class1   Class2
    |       |
Interface1 a = new Class1();


inheritance of interface

code is written but we need new features - we dont delete the old one
 create new interface same name but with index

 default method of interface - means that we dont need to override it in the classes

 every new class has a parent class Object
