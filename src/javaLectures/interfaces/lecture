Why there is no double inheritance in java;


class A int x
class B int x
class C int x
class d int x

interface always in a separate file
//interface example goceva git
initialize an object of the interface type

inheritance of interface

code is written but we need new features - we dont delete the old one
 create new interface same name but with index

 default method of interface - means that we dont need to override it in the classes
