-----What is a Daemon thread?-----------
Daemon thread is low-priority threads, we set a thread to be daemon when
we want it to terminate anytime it will interfere the main operations
(the high priority threads)

-----When to Use Daemon Threads---------
Use them for tasks that should run continuously in the background
and should terminate when the main application finishes.

-----Lifecycle Management---------------
They provide automatic cleanup and are ideal for housekeeping tasks.
