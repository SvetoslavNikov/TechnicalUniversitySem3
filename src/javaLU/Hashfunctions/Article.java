    //Hash function in programming is often used to compare two objects.
    //Hash functions can be customized, override.So it gives the same hash code,
    //when for example an important variable of our object is the same as in others.

    //Collusion is when two different inputs in a complex object result in two identical hashcodes.

    //equal default method returns true only if both objects have same reference
    //public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    //	    return (this == obj);
    //	  }
