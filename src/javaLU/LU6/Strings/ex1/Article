string in java are always stored in the heap and once stored
it does stay there until the program ends

adding a letter to string 1 000 000 times is a bottle neck slow af
that's why we use string builder - string builder works only over one object
and expanding it

Stack and Heap

stack - is the default memory allocated by the processor for the program

compiled program sees the whole file variables memory needs
kernel let you use this much memory in the stack
heap - is the access memory the free ram

when the stack needs more memory it ask the heap for more memory
that is slow

processor cash



















INTERVIEW QUESTION -
why boolean is one byte but not one bit
because the processor cant read more then one byte
